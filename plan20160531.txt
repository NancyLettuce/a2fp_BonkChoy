Steps to take: 
1. Rough draft (JL, NL, AL) : We will build our world around this. This is a prerequisite for everything else.
      -story
      -layout
2. Basic Room (JL) : This room will be the model for our following rooms. Allows us to see the limitations of processing.
      -test extent of processing possibility
      -Sprites/animation (maybe)
3. Setup Skeleton (NL, AL) : Extremely important. This allows our game to function. We will make use of a lot of second term material here.
      -inventory slots
      -Routes. Build world
      -Interaction of elements
4. Make puzzles (NL, AL, some JL) : Also extremely important. We will make use of a lot of second term material here.
      -Creativity???
5. Animation (JL) : Makes everything look nice and interesting.
