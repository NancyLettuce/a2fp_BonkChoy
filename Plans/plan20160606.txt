Steps to take (in order): 
1. Rough draft (JL, NL, AL) : We will build our world around this. This is a prerequisite for everything else.
      -story
      -layout
      -uml diagram
      -flowchart
      -missions
2. Basic Room (JL) : This room will be the model for our following rooms. Allows us to see the limitations of processing.
  Each room will be filled with objects. There will be regular objects that exit for the sake of decoration and special objects. 
  These special objects can be added to the inventory and later on used. We will use premade sprites for these special objects
  to facilitate manipulating them and these will add an additional animated aspect along with saving us time.
      -NL and AL will help depending on the extent of the detail
      -test extent of processing possibility
      -Sprites/animation with focus on the interaction between sprites and their surroundings
      -Themes will be implemented
      -If we have enough time, more floors/rooms will be added
3. Setup Skeleton (NL, AL) : Extremely important. This allows our game to function. We will make use of a lot of second term material 
  here.(Binary Trees, stacks, Knight's Tour...)
      -inventory slots
      -Routes. Build world
      -Interaction of elements
4. Make puzzles (NL, AL, some JL) : Also extremely important. We will make use of a lot of second term material here.
  Puzzles may necessitate the use of a popup screen. We will experiment with processing to implement this.
      -Creativity???
5. Animation* (JL) : Makes everything look nice and interesting.
6. Sound Effects???

*Because our project is so graphics-oriented, mastering processing is one of our top priorities.
If we run low on time, we will cut back on some of the detail to focus on algorithms. 

The most important part is making sure the two ends connect properly. We will make heavy usgae of mouse clicks.
